> *A resource for ASL learners to maintain vocabulary and practice grammar, with the intention of promoting Deaf community engagement*

## What

### User Experience

SignCraft provides a structured approach to ASL vocabulary building and grammar practice:

1. **Create Word Types** - Set up categories like "noun", "verb", "adjective" to organize vocabulary
2. **Build Templates** - Design sentence structures following ASL grammar patterns:
   - `PRONOUN + VERB + NOUN` â†’ "ME EAT FOOD"
   - `ADJECTIVE + NOUN + VERB` â†’ "BIG DOG RUN"
3. **Add Vocabulary** - Build your personal word bank, categorized by word type
4. **Practice & Generate** - Use templates to create random sentences for practice

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend Framework:** Phoenix (Elixir/Erlang)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Ecto
- **Frontend:** Phoenix with Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Fly.io with Docker
